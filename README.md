# XML-RPC Blogging Protocols #

The XML-RPC plugin provides support for the many flavors of the XML-RPC blogging protocols. These protocols allow clients to create content via remote clients, like Windows LiveWriter and Mars Edit. 

## Installation ##

To install the plugin:

1. Create a `addons/XMLRPC` directory in your MT/Melody directory.
2. Unpack the plugin into that directory.

## Usage ##

To use the plugin, reconfigure your XMLRPC client to use the plugin's `xmlrpc.cgi` path. For example, if your MT/Melody site is at:

    http://www.example.com/melody/index.cgi

Then use the following URL for your XMLRPC client:

    http://www.example.com/melody/addons/XMLRPC/xmlrpc.cgi
